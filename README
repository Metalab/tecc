Welcome To TECC - The Euler Coding Collective

We are a group of Hackers joined together on hackerspaces.org to solve
the coding problems from projecteuler.net in many different languages
to show the world the beauty of code and train our skill in those
programming languages.

You can find our Wikipage at:

If you are intersted in helping us solve more projecteuler.net problems
please just join hackerspaces, fork the code and send pull request. Or
send and request to be a collaborator.
